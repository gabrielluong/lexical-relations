Part 1.

To find hypernym relations, regular expressions for each Hearst's pattern was
used to match possible hypernym relations. Afterwards, the extract hypernym
relations are evaluated for 4 different cases with WordNet to determine if the
relation is valid. In building the regular expression for extracting the
relations, regular expressions to extract key components in the Hearst's pattern
were created and used to generate new regular expressions.

These components included:
{, NP_2, ..., {and|or} NP_j}, {,}, NP_0{, NP_1, ...,}, {and|or}

When extracting hyponyms in patterns such as NP_0{, NP_2, ..., {and|or} NP_j},
each hyponym NP is extracted out after capturing the entire pattern.

For NP which might contain more than one N, the individual nouns are extracted,
and joined by a _. Examples of this included box_office, political_leaders, etc.
This was effective for getting the proper WordNet synset.

On evaluating the correctness of the 4 different cases for the pair the program
found, overall, the consensus was that most pairings were correct with a few
exceptions. These examples can be examined in the Part 1 Evaluation. However,
some examples included HYPONYM(japan, chefs), and HYPONYM(picture_frames, tokyo)
for case 1. This seems to be a problem with the relations defined in WordNet.

In case 2, the pairs found were a bit more ambiguous since it was possible that
in some examples that the hyponym should be hypernym and vice versa. This was
illustrated in the examples HYPONYM(theft, abuse) and HYPONYM(crappies, panfish).
In both case 3 and 4, there were a significant number of correct pairs despite
the fact that WordNet may not have a relation for the pair. However, there were
a number of nonsense pairs that were reported for case 3 and 4 as a result of
WordNet not knowing the relations between the words. These included false
positive such as HYPONYM(the_professor, students), and HYPONYM(autism, childhood).

One consideration that was not taken into account by the chunk parser was that
the NP extracted is coming from a prepositional phrase in NP PP. The chunk
parser should be modified to extracted the central NP in NP PP instead of the NP
from PP, which may be defined as PP -> P NP. In additional, the NP extracted can
be improved by removing quotations. There were also pairs containing numerical
NPs such as HYPONYM(dinner, $150), which are incorrect. To mitigate this case,
a new rule to Hearst's pattern could be used to discard numerical NPs or perhaps
numerical quantities should not be classified as NPs by the POS tagger.
